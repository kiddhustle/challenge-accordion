# Accordion challenge overview
30 minutes to create a FAQ accordion where each question can be clicked and expanded

Must ensure

*	HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all attempted
*	For it to look presentable - but does not have to be ‘pixel perfect’
*	FAQ’s are rendered dynamically : FAQ’s are provided in JSON format. Ideally these would be AJAX’d in.
*	Clean code
*	Something that works after 30 minutes!

# Installation
`npm install`
# Running
Start HTTP server from the root of the project.

e.g: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
